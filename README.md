Gmail has introduced several updates to enhance user experience, security, and functionality. Here's an overview of the recent developments:
1. Enhanced Security Measures:
Real-Time Attachment Scanning: Gmail now performs immediate scans of email attachments upon arrival, detecting malware or harmful scripts to prevent users from downloading or opening infected files. 
Bulk Sender Authentication: To reduce spam, Gmail requires bulk senders (those sending over 5,000 emails daily) to authenticate their emails, provide easy unsubscribe options, and maintain low spam rates. 
Passkey Integration: Google has introduced passkeys, a simpler and more secure alternative to passwords, enhancing account protection.
User Experience Improvements:
Refreshed 'Updates' Inbox: Gmail has updated its 'Updates' inbox category to move lower-priority emails, such as account statements and confirmations, from the Primary to the Updates inbox, helping users focus on more important messages. 
Advanced Table Formatting in Sheets: Enhancements in Google Sheets include advanced formatting options for tables, allowing users to toggle gridlines, apply alternating colors, and manage table footers. 
3. Bug Fixes and Resolutions:
Third-Party App Access: Users faced issues adding Gmail accounts to Outlook, receiving messages about insecure apps. Adding https://accounts.google.com/ to Trusted Sites in Internet Options has been identified as a solution. 
Extension Permissions: A Gmail update affected how extensions perform actions like marking emails as read or deleting them. Extensions now require specific permissions to execute these actions. 
These updates reflect Google's commitment to enhancing Gmail's security and usability.
